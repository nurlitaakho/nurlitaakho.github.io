<div style="text-align: justify">K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is used for clustering data points into groups based on their similarity. It works by partitioning the data into k clusters, where k is a predefined number of clusters that you want to form. Visualization is an essential part of data analysis and machine learning, including K-Means clustering. There are many reasons why visualization is important for k-means clustering, an example is to Understanding the Data, Checking for Clustering Quality, Communicating Results, and Identifying Outliers. These GUI tools can be helpful for exploring your data and understanding the results of K-Means clustering.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><br>
Here are the steps to Use the K-Means Clustering Visualization GUI<br>
1. Input data<br>
2. Enter the number of clusters (k) you want to create.<br>
3. Select the distance to be used (Euclidean or Manhattan)<br>
4. Enter the distance on the x-axis.<br>
5. Enter the distance on the y-axis.<br>
6. Click the KMeans Plot button..</div>
